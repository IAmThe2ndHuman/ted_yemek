## version conmtrol tips and tricks
- master: bleeding edge branch, i will probably commit to a version branch once a release is ready??
 i have no idea how to do this correctly
- X.X.x: version branches (tags handle individual releases epicly)

tip: try to commit for every feature (method/refactor/indentation) that WON'T cause an error
